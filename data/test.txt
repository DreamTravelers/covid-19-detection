COVID-19 &&& 10.1016-slash-j.jhin.2020.03.036.png &&& The index patient, a 64-year-old woman, attended the Department of Accident and Emergency at 23:42 h on 1st February 2020 with fever, productive cough and breathlessness for 2 days. She developed flu-like symptoms on 24th January 2020 with transient improvement after taking antibiotics and symptomatic treatment prescribed by a general practitioner. However, her fever relapsed on 30th January 2020 with productive cough and dyspnea. She had no history of travel in the preceding month, but she owned a fashion boutique with many mainland Chinese customers owing to its proximity to the West Kowloon high-speed rail station. On admission, she had a fever of 39.6°C with sinus tachycardia of 126 bpm and blood pressure of 198/92 mmHg. She was tachypnoeic with oxygen saturation of 80% in room air. Bilateral crepitations were heard on auscultation and chest X-ray revealed multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates (Figure 2 (a)). In the absence of history of travel to China or contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, she was admitted to ward A in an open cubicle under standard precautions for community-acquired pneumonia (6 ACH, normal pressure setting) at 01:22 h on 2nd February 2020. She could not wear a surgical mask as she was on oxygen therapy through a simple facemask (Soundway®, Ningbo Shengyurui Medical Appliances Co. Ltd, Ningbo, China; Figure 2(b)). She also had frequent coughs while residing in the ward. She became more hypoxic around 18:00 h and required an increase in oxygen therapy to 8 L/min, delivered through the same facemask. On 3rd February 2020, she was transferred to an AIIR at 12:35 h and was electively intubated at 13:00 h for progressive respiratory failure. Nasopharyngeal swab for multiplex PCR FilmArray® RP2 panel (Biofire Diagnostics, bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France), urine for BinaxNOW Legionella and pneumococcal antigen (Abbott, IL, USA) were negative. The patient was tested for COVID-19 as enhanced laboratory surveillance on 3rd February 2020, where both combined NPA with throat swab, and tracheal aspirate showed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a Ct value of 22.8 and 26.1, respectively. The patient was subsequently transferred to the Infectious Diseases Centre, Princess Margaret Hospital, for further management.(a) Chest-X-ray of index patient on admission showing bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.

COVID-19 &&& 1-s2.0-S1059131120301151-gr2-f.png &&& On 12th March 2020 a 78-year-old woman was admitted to our Emergency Department for ongoing myoclonic jerks of the right face and right limbs. She suffered from hypertension and postencephalitic epilepsy. When she was 76, the patient developed a Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis. The initial presentation of the herpetic encephalitis were repetitive oral buccal automatisms and aphasia lasting 6 h associated with the electroencephalographic findings of subcontinuous epileptiform discharges over the left temporal fields, configuring a non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). The status epilepticus was successfully treated with a sequence of antiepileptic drugs. Because of the encephalitis, fluent aphasia and mild right limbs weakness persisted, with only a partial recovery after neuro-rehabilitation. Since then, the patient was steadily under treatment with valproic acid and levetiracetam and remained seizure-free for more than two years. She was under regular neurologic follow-up and the last electroencephalogram performed ten days prior to admission was normal (Fig. 1, label A). In the morning of 12th March 2020, the patient developed a focal status epilepticus without any prodromal symptoms. First Aid evaluation showed alert, eupnoeic patient with normal body temperature (36.1 °C). The neurological examination showed fluent aphasia, right central facial nerve palsy, pronation of the right arm and drift of the right leg. The patient displayed ongoing myoclonic jerks of the right eyelid and upper-lip, started two hours before. She was treated with intravenous valproic acid, followed by intravenous midazolam for the persistence of subintrant focal seizures. The electroencephalogram revealed semi-rhythmic, irregular, high amplitude delta activity, predominantly lateralized over the left fronto-centro-temporal regions, consistent with focal status epilepticus (Fig. 1, labels B and C). The antiepileptic treatment resolved the status epilepticus (Fig. 1, label D). Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain was negative for acute lesions. Brain MRI confirmed extensive gliosis and atrophy involving the left temporo-parietal lobe, in the absence of new cerebral lesions as documented by both diffusion weighted imaging and post-gadolinium sequences (Fig. 2, labels A–D). The chest X-ray was unremarkable (Fig. 2, label E). Laboratory analysis revealed lymphocytopenia (560 cells/mm3) and thrombocytopenia (125,000/mm3). Twelve hours after the admission to the Emergency Room, the patient developed fever. She did not exhibit respiratory symptoms, such as cough or dyspnoea. Her blood oxygenation was normal. The blood analysis showed a further decrease in the white cells and platelets count. The C-reactive protein was 29.7 mg/L, procalcitonine was 0.07 ng/mL. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, her fever did not improve. Blood cultures and urine culture were negative for common bacteria, fungi and neurotropic viruses. The epidemiological survey revealed that in the previous week the patient met her son, who went into preventive isolation afterwards for being in contact with three people with a positive swab for SARS-CoV-2. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs specimen of the patient were then obtained and Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed, which tested positive for SARS-CoV2. The patient was transferred to the Infectious Disease Unit and treated with lopinavir-ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine. After initiation of the treatment, the clinical conditions of the patient improved, with resolution of the fever. A further chest X-ray (Fig. 2, label F) and a lung ultrasound were negative for interstitial pneumonia. Since then, no other seizures occurred. During the hospitalization, she did not require oxygen therapy. On 28th March she was discharged in stable condition, afebrile after two negative swabs for SARS-CoV-2.

Her eGFR was 45 to 55 ml/min per 1.73 m2. She was maintained on tacrolimus with levels between 5 and 8 ng/ml, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 250 mg twice a day (BD), and prednisolone 5 mg OD. Her other medications included ramipril, aspirin, alfacalcidol, and amiloride. She presented on March 5 with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral patchy consolidation (Figure 1a). SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase chain reaction tests from nose and throat viral swabs were positive. Bronchial washing for pneumocystis polymerase chain reaction was negative, as was blood polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus DNA. There was no other positive microbiological diagnosis. She was hypoxic with peripheral oxygen saturation of 86% and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, so she was transferred to intensive therapy unit (ITU) and commenced noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure for type 1 respiratory failure) and subsequent intubation and ventilation as her clinical condition deteriorated. Serum CRP on admission was 83 mg/l, hemoglobin 110 g/l, with normal total white cell count, and mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0.8 × 109/l). She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. No specific antiviral drugs were given. MMF was ceased. Low-dose tacrolimus was initially continued but stopped 1 day before death. On day 3 post admission, she developed acute kidney injury (AKI), with a serum creatinine increase to 225 μmol/l. She remained stable on the ventilator with reducing oxygen requirements and improvement in lung infiltrates on chest X-ray (Figure 1b) but deteriorated markedly on March 16 with high serum lactate and lactate dehydrogenase levels and an acute rise of CRP to 190. She developed severe metabolic acidosis resistant to correction on continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, probably owing to an intra-abdominal event (bowel infarction and/or intra-abdominal sepsis). She deteriorated rapidly and died on March 17. (a) on admission showing bilateral patchy consolidation

COVID-19 &&& 270_2020_2470_Fig1_HTML-b.png &&& A 63-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer and recurrent malignant pleural effusion came to our institutional ER with fever (39 °C) and dyspnea at rest. Being our institute located in a severely involved area of the COVID-19 outbreak, clinical symptoms were compatible with COVID-19 infection. Laboratory parameters included hemoglobin 10.7, white blood cells 3.98, C-reactive protein 43.5, arterial pH 7.5, pO2 53 mmHg, pCO2 31 mmHg and blood lactate concentration 1 mmol/L. Although the patient underwent a right pleurodesis 6 months ago, chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion (loculated on the right side) as well as interstitial thickening (Fig. 1A), a common imaging feature in COVID-19. She underwent a naso-/oropharyngeal swab which turned positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after being processed through a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Novel Coronavirus PCR Fluorescence Diagnostic Kit, BioGerm Medical Biotechnology). She started as an inpatient with 1 week of non-invasive assisted ventilation that reduced fever, clinical symptoms and normalized inflammatory laboratory values such as C-reactive protein. Still, respiratory function and blood oxygen levels remained poor despite an increase in FiO2 from 60 to 70%. Consequently, percutaneous drainage was requested with the aim of improving ventilation and blood oxygen saturation. The procedure was performed at the bedside in an isolated ward dedicated to COVID-19 patients. The operator wore an FFp2 mask, double gloves, protective glasses and a surgical gown (Fig. 2). After local anesthesia, two 8F multi-hole drainages were inserted bilaterally using dedicated US equipment in the isolated ward as image guidance. The procedure lasted approximately 1 h and was well tolerated. Around 1800 mL was drained in the next 5 h from both sides. All disposable equipment and devices were then immediately discarded in specific containers. Post-procedural chest X-rays showed a marked increase in the ventilated parenchyma. Along with clinical symptoms, also laboratory markers rapidly improved and blood saturation levels reached the normal range (SpO2 98%). The patient switched from assisted ventilation to a simple face mask (2 L/min O2) and maintained normal peripheral capillary oxygen saturation. At the time of writing, she is alive and close to hospital discharge. A Chest X-ray shows bilateral pleural effusion and diffuse interstitial thickening. B Chest X-ray performed 24 h after bilateral pleural drainages shows nearly complete resolution of the pleural effusions on both sides
COVID-19 &&& 1-s2.0-S2214250920300834-gr1_lrg-b.png &&& A 78-year-old woman, a non-smoker with dyslipidemia and hypothyroidism presented to her primary care physician on 13 February with general malaise and anorexia lasting several days. She did not have other symptoms, such as fever, cough, sputum, or dyspnoea. She had visited Paris, France, from 30 January to 4 February 2020. At that time, her vital signs were within normal limits, including SpO2 (i.e., 98 % on room air) (Fig. 1A). On 18 February, she complained of cough and exacerbation of malaise and anorexia and had an associated 3 kg body weight loss. She was referred to our hospital because of a bilateral reticular shadow seen on chest X-rays (Fig. 1B) and ground-glass opacity (GGO) adjacent to the pleura seen on chest computed tomography (CT) (Fig. 1C, D). At the time of her visit, she had a temperature of 37.7 °C; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; heart rate, 106 beats/min (regular); blood pressure, 139/63 mmHg; and SPO2 of 95 % on room air. Admission blood tests showed elevated C-reactive protein (7.9 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (106 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (80 U/L), γ-glutamyltransferase (153 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (372 U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (383 U/L). Other blood test results were within the normal range. COVID-19 was suggested based on her prolonged clinical symptoms, travel history, and chest X-ray and CT findings. We thus performed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of a sputum specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection. A rapid influenza test, conducted simultaneously, was positive for influenza A virus, and she was started on oseltamivir with ceftriaxone 2 g/day and azithromycin 500 mg/day to cover possible bacterial infections. One day after oseltamivir initiation, on 19 February, she became afebrile. The PCR assay performed on admission tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 20 February. By 21 February, her general malaise had worsened. Chest X-ray (Fig. 1E) and CT (Fig. 1F, G), re-examined on 25 February, showed improvements in previously noted GGO, appearing more like a consolidation. Given the improvement in her clinical symptoms and CT findings, another PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed on 26 February which tested still positive. Subsequent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing on 1 and 2 March tested negative, and the patient was discharged on 5 March. Chest X-ray (Fig. 1H) and CT (Fig. 1I, J) images obtained a day before discharge showed improvements of previously noted consolidation and GGO. She did not require oxygen therapy throughout her hospital stay.

Normal &&& 1-s2.0-S1059131120301151-gr2-e.png &&& On 12th March 2020 a 78-year-old woman was admitted to our Emergency Department for ongoing myoclonic jerks of the right face and right limbs. She suffered from hypertension and postencephalitic epilepsy. When she was 76, the patient developed a Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) encephalitis. The initial presentation of the herpetic encephalitis were repetitive oral buccal automatisms and aphasia lasting 6 h associated with the electroencephalographic findings of subcontinuous epileptiform discharges over the left temporal fields, configuring a non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). The status epilepticus was successfully treated with a sequence of antiepileptic drugs. Because of the encephalitis, fluent aphasia and mild right limbs weakness persisted, with only a partial recovery after neuro-rehabilitation. Since then, the patient was steadily under treatment with valproic acid and levetiracetam and remained seizure-free for more than two years. She was under regular neurologic follow-up and the last electroencephalogram performed ten days prior to admission was normal (Fig. 1, label A). In the morning of 12th March 2020, the patient developed a focal status epilepticus without any prodromal symptoms. First Aid evaluation showed alert, eupnoeic patient with normal body temperature (36.1 °C). The neurological examination showed fluent aphasia, right central facial nerve palsy, pronation of the right arm and drift of the right leg. The patient displayed ongoing myoclonic jerks of the right eyelid and upper-lip, started two hours before. She was treated with intravenous valproic acid, followed by intravenous midazolam for the persistence of subintrant focal seizures. The electroencephalogram revealed semi-rhythmic, irregular, high amplitude delta activity, predominantly lateralized over the left fronto-centro-temporal regions, consistent with focal status epilepticus (Fig. 1, labels B and C). The antiepileptic treatment resolved the status epilepticus (Fig. 1, label D). Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain was negative for acute lesions. Brain MRI confirmed extensive gliosis and atrophy involving the left temporo-parietal lobe, in the absence of new cerebral lesions as documented by both diffusion weighted imaging and post-gadolinium sequences (Fig. 2, labels A–D). The chest X-ray was unremarkable (Fig. 2, label E). Laboratory analysis revealed lymphocytopenia (560 cells/mm3) and thrombocytopenia (125,000/mm3). Twelve hours after the admission to the Emergency Room, the patient developed fever. She did not exhibit respiratory symptoms, such as cough or dyspnoea. Her blood oxygenation was normal. The blood analysis showed a further decrease in the white cells and platelets count. The C-reactive protein was 29.7 mg/L, procalcitonine was 0.07 ng/mL. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, her fever did not improve. Blood cultures and urine culture were negative for common bacteria, fungi and neurotropic viruses. The epidemiological survey revealed that in the previous week the patient met her son, who went into preventive isolation afterwards for being in contact with three people with a positive swab for SARS-CoV-2. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs specimen of the patient were then obtained and Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed, which tested positive for SARS-CoV2. The patient was transferred to the Infectious Disease Unit and treated with lopinavir-ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine. After initiation of the treatment, the clinical conditions of the patient improved, with resolution of the fever. A further chest X-ray (Fig. 2, label F) and a lung ultrasound were negative for interstitial pneumonia. Since then, no other seizures occurred. During the hospitalization, she did not require oxygen therapy. On 28th March she was discharged in stable condition, afebrile after two negative swabs for SARS-CoV-2.
